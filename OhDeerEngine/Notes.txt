first make some components to make all of this work
cause right now it's gameobject based

rendercomponent - this is same - texture component
textcomponent

lets remake the resourcemanager, cause right now it's a resourceloader


sooooo ruben is a beast and helped me do sprite animations, letsagoo
msperupdate = value we want each update to update by


textcomponent: what am I actually trying to do, make it so that once you load a texture, it is in memory and you can find it again


 - sound in resourcemanager
 - transformcomponent
 
 
needed for game:
 - score
	-> saving of scores
 - lifes
 - enemy behaviour
 - destructable map
 - pickups -> collision
 - level loader
 - reading of info files
 - input manager -> controller support
