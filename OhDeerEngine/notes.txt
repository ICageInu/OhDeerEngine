so here is my devlog for programming 4 the engine


TODO list:

	- gameloop
		right now I'm in this weird state of using both the one we saw in the slides for getting correct deltaTimes
		and the one from sfml, the reason I'm in the weird state is because sfml being weird and the deltaTimes weren't correct
		further reading required


	- sprites -> texturecomponent, this should actually be working but lemme take a look what else needs to be added here
	
	- controller component
		this is not gonna be a thing, make a character component that functions together with the input
		but make sure that this actually functions properly
	- a spritemanager
	
	- animations
	
	- basic physix
		use box2d
	- collision
		see above
	- collision tags
		see above
	- inputmanager
		this shenanigans is scuffed, try to use it somewhere but oh well
		so for the inputmanager, how do I wanna look for it, do I want to be able to overwrite the inputs?
		wouldn't it be better to 
		ruben is bae and helped me
		doesn't work yest, also haven't tried to implement it so I can't be sure but it shouldn't work
	- memory pool
		only use this for particles if you want to use that
		
	- renderer
		so basically
		we want to render the gameobject at position x,y
		the transformcomponents should hold this, but because I'm dumb I'm unable to find out how to work with the sf::transform
		the sprite itself has a position as well, thing is as far as I'm getting it, I should be able to change the 
		position of the sprite depending on that of the gameobject
		
	- logger
		I mean ImGui has a logger amirite? what I can do is make easy acces to what you want to log
		
	- gameobjects
		DO NOT BOTHER WITH FACTORY FUNCTIONS FOR NOW
		first get engine working after that go to game directory and make .h with factory functions
	- resource manager
		- right now it works with multiple ways of setting the texture that you load in before with the resource manager, or by literally just
		giving a link to the assetfile that will load in the texture
		think that is it for the textures, should be focusing on font for now?
